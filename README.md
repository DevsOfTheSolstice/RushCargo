## About Rush Cargo
The name "Rush Cargo" symbolizes the project's aim to create a fast approach to handle packages throughout cities, regions and countries.

Aside from this, Rush Cargo also has some interesting easter eggs:

1. Rush: Besides its meaning related to fast shippings, Rush is also a reference to the main programming language that powers this application, Rust.

2. Cargo: This word is also a reference to the Rust ecosystem, this time to the Rust package manager.
